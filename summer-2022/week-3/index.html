    <p>Your sneakers shouldn't be the most exciting thing about you. They are tools, and what matters about your tools is that they work. They do their job so you can do yours. You put them on and forget about them. You focus on getting a little bit faster, a little bit sharper, on finding the signal in the noise.</p>

    <p>It took us 10 years to make a sneaker this simple——as simple as can be and no simpler. A do-more sneaker. An own-less sneaker. A show-up, prove-it, whole-life, be-you sneaker.</p>
